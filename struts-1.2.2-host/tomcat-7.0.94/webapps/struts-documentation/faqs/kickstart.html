<h2 id="why">Why do we need Struts?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>Java technologies give developers a serious boost when creating and maintaining applications to meet the demands of today's public Web sites and enterprise intranets. Struts combines Java Servlets, Java ServerPages, custom tags, and message resources into a unified framework. The end result is a cooperative, synergistic platform, suitable for development teams, independent developers, and everyone in between.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="how">How does Struts work?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>Java Servlets are designed to handle requests made by Web browsers. Java ServerPages are designed to create dynamic Web pages that can turn billboard sites into live applications. Struts uses a special Servlet as a switchboard to route requests from Web browsers to the appropriate ServerPage. This makes Web applications much easier to design, create, and maintain.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="compat">Is Struts compatible with other Java technologies?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>Yes. Struts is committed to supporting industry standards.
    Struts acts as an integrator of Java technologies so that they can be used in the "real world".</p>
</div>
<h2 id="who">Who wrote Struts?</h2>
<div class="indent">
    <p>There are several <a href="../volunteers.html">active committers</a> to the Struts project, working cooperatively from around the globe.  Dozens of individual developers and committers contributed to the Struts 1.x codebase. All interested Java developers are invited to <a href="helping.html#contribute">contribute to the project</a>.
    Struts is a <a href="http://apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>  project, with the mission to "provide secure, enterprise-grade server solutions based on the Java Platform that are developed in an open and cooperative fashion".</p>
    <p>Struts was created by Craig R. McClanahan and donated to The Apache Software Foundation in May 2000. Craig was the primary developer of both Struts 1.x and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html">Tomcat 4</a>. Tomcat 4 was the basis for the official reference implementation for a servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 container.</p>
    <p>Craig's current focus is as architect of the Sun Java Studio Creator (formerly Project Rave).
    Craig also serves as the Specification Lead for <a href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/127.jsp">JavaServer Faces (JSR-127)</a>,
    and is the Web Layer Architect for the Java2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) platform as a whole.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="struts">Why is it called Struts?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>It's a reference to struts in the architectural sense, a reminder of the nearly invisible pieces that hold up buildings, houses, and bridges.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="license">How is Struts licensed?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>Struts is copyrighted software available under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses">Apache License</a>, a "free-to-use, business-friendly license".</p>
</div>
<h2 id="usage">Can Struts be used in a commercial product?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>Yes. The only requirements you must meet are those listed in the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses">Apache License</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="credits">Do I have to credit Struts on my own website?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>You need to credit Struts if you <strong>redistribute your own framework</strong> based on Struts
for other people to use. (See the <a href="http://www.apache.org/LICENSE">Apache License</a> for details.)
But you do <strong>not</strong> need to credit Struts just because your web application utilizes the framework.
It's the same situation as using the Apache HTTPD server or Tomcat. Not required if its just running your web site.
Required if you've used the source code to create your own server that you are redistributing to other people.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="where">Where can I get a copy of Struts?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>The best place to download Struts is at <a href="http://struts.apache.org/">struts.apache.org</a>. The nightly builds are very stable, and recommended as the best place to start today.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="install">How do I install Struts?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>To develop applications with Struts, you can usually just add the Struts JAR file
to your Java development environment. You can then start using the Struts classes as
part of your own application. A blank Struts application (in the
<code>webapps</code> directory, open <code>struts-blank.war</code>)
is provided, which you can just copy to get a quick-start on your own brainchild.</p>
<p>Since the full source code for Struts is available, we also provide
<a href="../userGuide/installation.html">complete instructions</a>
for compiling your own Struts JAR from scratch. (This is actually easier than it looks!)</p>
<p>Your Struts application can usually be deployed using a standard WAR file. In most
cases, you simply deposit the WAR file on your application server, and it is installed
automatically. If not, step-by-step installation instructions for
<a href="../userGuide/installation.html#Containers">various servlet
containers</a> are available.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="jar">When do I need "struts.jar" on my classpath?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>When you are compiling an application that uses the Struts classes, you must have the "struts.jar" on the classpath your <strong>compiler</strong> sees -- it does not <em> have</em> to be on your CLASSPATH environment variable.</p>
<p>Why is that an important distinction? Because if you are using a servlet container on your development machine to test your application, the "struts.jar" <strong>must not</strong> be on your CLASSPATH environment variable when running the container. (This is because each Web application must also have their own copy of the Struts classes, and the container will become confused if it is on the environment path as well.)</p>
<p>There are several general approaches to this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Use ANT</strong> for building your projects -- it can easily assemble classpaths for the compiler.  (This is how Struts itself is  built, along with Tomcat and most other Java-based projects).</li>
<li>
<strong>Use an IDE</strong> where you can configure the "class path" used  for compilation independent of the CLASSPATH environment  variable.</li>
<li>
<strong>Use a shell script</strong> that temporarily adds struts.jar  to the classpath just for compilation, for example<br />
<em>javac -classpath /path/to/struts.jar:$CLASSPATH $@</em>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="tests">Does Struts include its own unit tests?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>
Struts currently has two testing environments, to reflect the fact that
some things can be tested statically, and some really need to be done in
the environment of a running servlet container.</p>
<p>
For static unit tests, we use the <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit framework</a>.
The sources for these tests are in the "src/test"
hierarchy in the CVS repository, and are executed via the "test.junit"
target in the top-level build.xml file.  Such tests are focused on the
low-level functionality of individual methods, are particularly
suitable for the static methods in the org.apache.struts.util utility
classes.  In the test hierarchy, there are also some "mock object" classes
(in the org.apache.struts.mock package) so that you can package up things
that look like servlet API and Struts API objects to pass in as arguments
to such tests.</p>
<p>
Another valuable tool is
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/strutstestcase/">Struts TestCase</a>
which provides a useful harness for Action classes that can be used with JUnit or
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus">Cactus</a>.
</p>
</div>
<h2 id="requests">If the framework doesn't do what I want, can I request that a feature be added?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>
First, it's important to remember that Struts is an all-volunteer project.
We don't charge anyone anything to use Struts.
Committers and other developers work on Struts because they need to use it with their own applications.
If others can use it too, that's "icing on the cake".
If you <a href="../helping.html">submit a patch</a> for a feature that a Committer finds useful, then that Committer may choose to volunteer his or her time to apply the patch.
If you just submit an idea without a patch, it is much less likely to be added (since first someone else has to volunteer their time to write the patch).
</p>
<p>
We are grateful for any patches, and we welcome new ideas, but the best way to see that something gets added to the framework is to do as much of the work as you can, rather than rely on the "kindness of strangers". Worst case, you can apply the patch to your copy of Struts and still use the feature in your own application. (Which is what open source is ~really~ all about.)
</p>
</div>
<h2 id="help">Where can I get help with Struts?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>The Struts package comes complete with a
<a href="../userGuide/index.html">Users Guide</a> to
introduce people to the framework and its underlying technologies. Various components
also have their own in-depth Developers Guide, to cover more advanced topics. Comprehensive
<a href="../api/index.html">Javadocs</a> are included
along with the <strong>full source code</strong>. For your convenience, these are bundled together as
a self-installing application. The <code>struts-documentation.war</code> is the same
bundle that is deployed as the
<a href="http://struts.apache.org/">Struts Web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="http://struts.apache.org/using.html#lists">Strut's mailing list</a> is also
very active, and welcomes posts from new users. Before posting a new question, be
sure to consult the
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/struts-user%40jakarta.apache.org/">
<strong>MAILING LIST ARCHIVE</strong>
</a> and the very excellent

How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</a> by Eric Raymond. Please do be sure

email client before posting.
</p>
</div>
<h2 id="support">Is commercial support available?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>There is no official, commercial support for Struts, though third parties may offer different degrees of support. </p>
</div>
<h2 id="providers">Are there ISPs that will host my Struts application?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>For a listing of some Java and Struts ISPs, visit the <a href="http://struts.sf.net/commnity/index.html">Struts Community Resources</a> area on SourceForge.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="turbine">What's the difference between Struts and Turbine? What's the difference between Struts and Expresso?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>
If you are starting from scratch, packages like
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine">Turbine</a> and
<a href="http://jcorporate.com">Expresso</a>
can be very helpful since they try to provide all of the basic services that your team is likely to need.
Such services include things like data persistence and logging.
</p>
<p>
If you are not starting from scratch, and need to hook up your web application to an existing infrastructure, then "plain vanilla" Struts can be a better choice.
The core Struts framework does not presuppose that you are using a given set of data persistence, presentation, or logging tools.
Anything goes =:0)
</p>
<p>
Compared to other offerings, Struts endeavors to be a minimalist framework.
We try leverage existing technologies whenever we can and provide only the missing pieces you need to combine disparate technologies into a coherent application.
This is great when you want to select your own tools to use with Struts.
But, if you prefer a more integrated infrastructure, then packages like Turbine or Expresso (which uses Struts) are perfectly good ways to go.

</div>
<h2 id="taglibs">Why aren't the Struts tags maintained as part of the Jakarta Taglibs project?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>Development of both products began about the same time. Leading up to the release of 1.0, it was thought better to continue to develop the taglibs alongside the controller. Now that 1.0 is out, the JavaServer Pages Standard Taglib is in active development. Once work on JSTL stabilizes, the Struts taglibs will be revisited. Tags which are not linked directly to the framework may be hosted at Jakarta Taglibs instead.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="xhtml">Are the Struts tags XHTML compliant?</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>If you use an &lt;html:html xhtml="true&gt; or &lt;html:xhtml/&gt; element on your page, the tags
will render as XHTML (since Struts 1.1). </p>
</div>
<h2 id="wml">Will the Struts tags support other markup languages such as WML</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>
Struts itself is markup neutral. The original Struts taglibs are only one example of how
presentation layer components can access the framework. The framework objects are exposed
through the standard application, session, and request contexts, where any Java component in
the application can make use of them.
</p>

<p>Markup extensions that use Struts are available for
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity">Velocity</a> and
<a href="http://www.openroad.ca/opencode/">XLST</a>, among others.
A new Struts tag library for
<a href="#jsf">Java Server Faces</a> is also in development.
</p>

</div>
<h2 id="jsf">What about JSTL and JavaServer Faces?</h2>
<div class="indent">
    <p>
       JSTL, the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/jstl/">
       JavaServer Standard Tag Library</a>, is a set of JSP tags that
       are designed to make it easier to develop Web applications.
       <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/">JavaServer Faces</a>
       (JSF) is a specification for a new technology that promises to make
       it easier to write MVC applications, both for the Web and for the
       desktop.
    </p>
<p>
The inventor of Struts, Craig McClanahan, is the specification co-lead for
JavaServer Faces (JSR 127), and architect of the reference implemenation
as well as Java Studio Creator. Both JSTL and JSF are complementary to Struts.</p>
<p>
The mainstay of the Struts framework is the controller components, which
can be used with any Java presentation technology. As new technologies
become available, it is certain that new "glue" components will also
appear to help these technologies work as well with Struts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Struts originally came bundled with a set of custom JSP tags.
        Today, several extensions are available to help
        you use Struts with other popular presentation technologies, like
        XSLT and Velocity. Likewise, extensions for JSTL and JSF are now available as well.
    </p>
<p>
    The JSTL reference implementation is available through the
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/doc/standard-doc/intro.html">Jakarta Taglibs site</a>.
    A JSTL taglibs for Struts,
    <a href="../userGuide/building_view.html#struts-el">
<strong>Struts-El</strong>
</a>,
    is available and distributed with Struts beginning with the 1.1 release.
</p>
    <p>
        The JSF specification and reference implementation is available through Sun's
        The JSF specification and reference implementation is available through Sun's
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/index.jsp">Java ServerFaces page</a>.
        An early-release JavaServer Faces taglib for Struts,
        <strong>Struts-Faces</strong>, is also in early release and available through the
        <a href="http://cvs.apache.org/builds/jakarta-struts/nightly/struts-faces/">nightly build</a>.
        The Struts Faces taglib is expected to work with any compliant JSF implementation, including
        <a href="http://www.myfaces.org/">MyFaces</a>.
