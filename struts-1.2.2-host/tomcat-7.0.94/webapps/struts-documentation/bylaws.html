<h1>Apache Struts Project Bylaws</h1>
<h2>Charter</h2>
<div class="indent">

    <p>
    Struts is a Project of the <a href="http://apache.org/foundation">
    Apache Software Foundation</a> (ASF), formed by a resolution of the
    <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/board/">ASF Board of
    Directors</a>. As an ASF Project, Struts is subject to the
    <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html">ASF Bylaws</a>
    and the direction of the ASF Board.
    </p>

    </div>
<h2>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
<div class="indent">

    <p>
    The roles and responsibilities that people can assume in the project
    are based on merit. Everybody can help no matter what their role.
    Those who have been longterm or valuable contributors to the project
    can earn the right to commit directly to the source repository and to
    cast binding votes during the decision-making process.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Users.</strong>
    Users are the people who use the products of the Project. People in
    this role aren't contributing code, but they are using the products,
    reporting bugs, making feature requests, and such. This is by far
    the most important category of people as, without users, there is no
    reason for the Project. When a user starts to contribute code or
    documentation patches, they become a Contributor.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Contributors.</strong>
    Contributors are the people who write code or documentation patches or
    contribute positively to the project in other ways. When a volunteer's
    patch is applied, the contribution is recognized in the CVS log.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Committers.</strong>
    Contributors who give frequent and valuable contributions to a
    subproject of the Project can have their status promoted to that of
    a "<em>Committer</em>" for that subproject. A Committer
    has write access to the source code repository. Committer status is
    granted by the Project Management Committee by majority vote.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Project Management Committee (PMC).</strong>
    Committers and other volunteers who frequently participate with
    valuable contributions may have their status promoted to that of a
    "<em>Project Management Committee Member</em>". The PMC
    is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Project.
    </p>

    </div>
<h2>Management</h2>
<div class="indent">

    <p>
    The Vice President is appointed by the ASF Board. The Vice
    President is assisted by the Project Management Committee (PMC)
    and also serves as the PMC chair. The PMC may nominate new
    members. Nominees may then be approved with a 3/4 majority vote
    of the PMC. Membership can be revoked by a unanimous vote of all
    the active PMC members other than the member in question. The
    list of active PMC members can be found on our
    <a href="volunteers.html">Volunteers page</a>.
    </p>

    </div>
<h2>PMC Duties</h2>
<div class="indent">

    <p>
    The PMC is responsible for the day-to-day
    management of the Struts Project. The PMC oversees all changes
    made to the codebase. The PMC must ensure that all code under a
    Apache Struts CVS is the lawful property of the Foundation and
    may be distributed under the <a href="http://apache.org/licenses/">
    Apache Software License</a>. All releases of a Struts subproject
    must be sanctioned by the Project Management Committee.
    </p>

    </div>
<h2>Subprojects</h2>
<div class="indent">

    <p>
    Subprojects are the Project's unit of release. Each subproject should
    represent an implementation of the Struts core or a related component.
    Each subproject should focus on creating, maintaining, and releasing a
    single software product or "deliverable".
    </p>

    <p>
    All PMC Members have voting rights in all subprojects. Members not familiar
    with a subproject codebase may abstain from any given vote. All Committers
    have write access to all subprojects. Subprojects are units of release, not
    units of work.
    </p>

    <p>
    PMC members may propose the creation of new subprojects. Proposals are
    to contain the scope of the project, identify the initial source from
    which the project is to be populated, identify any mailing lists or
    repositories, if any, which are to be created. Creation of a new
    subproject requires approval by a 3/4 majority vote of the PMC.
    </p>

    </div>
<h2>Decision Making</h2>
<div class="indent">

    <p>
    All Volunteers are encouraged to participate in decisions, but the
    decision itself is made by the Project Management Committee.
    The Project is a "<em>Minimum Threshod Meritocracy</em>".
    </p>

    </div>
<h2>Voting</h2>
<div class="indent">

    <p>
    Any subscriber to the list may vote on any issue or action item.
    Votes from Contributors and Committers are especially welcome.
    However, the only binding votes are those cast by a PMC Member.
    </p>

    <p>
    The act of voting carries certain obligations. Voters are not only
    stating their opinion, they are also agreeing to help do the work.
    </p>

    <p>Each vote can be made in one of three flavors:</p>

    <table>
    <tr>
    <td>
<strong>+1</strong>
</td>
    <td>
        "Yes," "Agree," or "the action should be
        performed." On some issues this is only binding if the voter
        has tested the action on their own system(s).
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>
<strong>+/-0</strong>
</td>
    <td>
        "Abstain," "no opinion". An abstention may
        have detrimental effects if too many people abstain.
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>
<strong>-1</strong>
</td>
    <td>
        <p>
        "No." On issues where consensus is required, this vote
        counts as a <strong>veto</strong>. All vetos must contain an
        explanation of why the veto is appropriate. Vetos with no
        explanation are void. A veto cannot be overruled. If you disagree
        with the veto, you should lobby the person who cast the veto.
        Voters intending to veto an action item should make their opinions
        known to the group immediately so that the problem can be remedied
        as early as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
        If a Committer tries to "override" a veto by restoring a vetoed
        change, the PMC may ask the infrastructure team to revoke that
        Committer's write privileges.
        </p>
    </td>
    </tr>

    </table>

    <p>
    An action requiring consensus approval must receive at least
    <strong>3 binding +1</strong> votes and <strong>no binding
    vetos</strong>. An action requiring majority approval must receive
    at least <strong>3 binding +1</strong> votes and more
    <strong>+1</strong> votes than <strong>-1</strong> votes. All other
    action items are considered to have lazy approval until somebody
    votes <strong>-1</strong>, after which point they are decided by
    either consensus or majority vote, depending on the type of action
    item.
    </p>
    <p>
    Voting represent consensus and votes are never final. Circumstances
    change, and so may votes. A veto may be converted to a +1 after
    discussion, and likewise a +1 may be converted to a -1.
    By convention, Committers should allow a vote to circulate for 72
    hours before taking action.
    </p>
     </div>
<h2>Action Items</h2>
<div class="indent">

    <p>
    All decisions revolve around "<em>Action
    Items.</em>" Action Items consist of the following:
    </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Long Term Plans</li>
            <li>Short Term Plans</li>
            <li>Product Changes</li>
            <li>Showstoppers</li>
            <li>Release Plan</li>
            <li>Release Grade</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
<h2>Long Term Plans</h2>
<div class="indent">

    <p>
    Long term plans are simply announcements that group members are
    working on particular issues related to the Project. These are not
    voted on, but Committers and PMC Members who do not agree with a
    particular plan, or think that an alternative plan would be better,
    are obligated to inform the group of their feelings.
    </p>

    </div>
<h2>Short Term Plan</h2>
<div class="indent">

    <p>
    Short term plans are announcements that a volunteer is working on a
    particular set of documentation or code files with the implication
    that other volunteers should avoid them or try to coordinate their
    changes.
    </p>

    </div>
<h2>Product Changes</h2>
<div class="indent">

    <p>
    All product changes to the repository are subject to
    lazy consensus.
    </p>

    </div>
<h2>Showstoppers</h2>
<div class="indent">

    <p>
    Showstoppers are issues that require a fix be in place before the
    next public release. They are listed in the status file in order to
    focus special attention on these problems. An issue becomes a
    showstopper when it is listed as such in the status file and remains
    so by lazy consensus.
    </p>

    </div>
<h2>Release Plan</h2>
<div class="indent">

      <p>
      A release plan may be used to keep all volunteers aware of when a
      release is desired, who will be the release manager, when the
      repository will be tagged to create a release, and other assorted
      information to keep volunteers from tripping over each other. Lazy
      majority decides each issue in a release plan.
      </p>

      </div>
<h2>Release Grade</h2>
<div class="indent">

    <p>
    After a new release is built, it must be tested and classified before
    being released to the general public. A release is automatically
    assigned an "Alpha" status. The release grade may be changed to
    "Beta" or "General Availability" by majority vote. Once a release is
    classified by the PMC Members, it can be distributed to the general
    public on behalf of the Foundation.
    </p>

    <p>
    Once a release is tagged and built (or "rolled"), it should not be
    rebuilt. If a problem is found, that release may be left at Alpha
    or Beta status and the next release created.
    </p>
