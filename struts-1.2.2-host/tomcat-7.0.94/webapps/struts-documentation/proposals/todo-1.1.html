  <h2 id="Intro">Introduction</h2>
<div class="indent">

  <p>Application frameworks, like the applications we build with them,
  never seem to be completed.  The following major areas of improvement
  are being considered for implementation in a future version 
  of Struts. </p>

  <p>Which features are implemented first depends greatly on 
  individual developers becoming involved in the process. Many key 
  features in Struts grew out of code first distributed on the mailing 
  list. If there is a feature here that you need, or already have, please 
  start a thread and show us the code!</p>

  <p class="center">
<a href="../faqs/helping.html#release">
<strong>So, when is the next release coming out?</strong>
</a>
</p>

  <p>An external development that is likely to affect the development of
  Struts 1.1 will be the emerging Standard Tag Library, being produced under
  the <a href="http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/52.jsp">Java Community Process</a>. 
  A very early release is now available at 
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/doc/jsptl-doc/intro.html">Jakarta 
  Taglibs</a>.</p>

  <p>The existing Struts tags were used as input to the standardization process,
  but in the case where standard tags with similar functionality are adopted,
  we should migrate Struts tags to maintain maximum compatibility with the
  new standard library.</p>

  </div>

  <h2 id="pending">Pending Tasks</h2>
<div class="indent">
  
  <ul>
  <li>

  <p>The wish list tasks are divided into functional areas that correspond
  to the major components of the Struts Framework. References in square
  brackets are the Java package containing the corresponding source code. 
  Listing a task here is not a guarantee that it will be present in the 
  next release. Again, whether a wish becomes a feature depends on whether 
  there are volunteers who choose to work on the task. </p>

        to organizing your business logic.

        events will undoubtedly be influenced by changes related to other
        work items on this list (such as workflow processing and standard
        validations), so work on this should be coordinated with those
