1. Install typescript for VSCODE.
2. Types for primitives are 
     var x:boolean, y:number, z:string;
3. For array 
     var myArray:number[]=[12,20]  ---> is valid
     var myArray:number[]=[12,'s']  ---> is invalid
     but var myArray:any[]=[12,'s'] ---> is valid

4. For function also we can define the return type of the functions
5. void is similar to java return type, which means nothing to return.
5. Interfaces are defined for the 
   - Declarations of the functions, so when the developer comes back and see the blueprint or the exact expectation of the function
   - To define the beans or entity objects or ViewObjects or JSONS
   - Similar to Java Interace but with non static properties.
   - In simple terms to define a Type in typescript.
